# blint

**blint** is a lightweight and easy-to-use linter for Windows batch files (`.bat`). It helps you identify syntax errors and enforce best practices to write cleaner and more reliable batch scripts.

## Features

- Detects common syntax errors in batch scripts
- Warns about potential pitfalls and style issues
- Simple command-line usage
- Provides clear, actionable feedback

## Installation

Clone the repository:

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/crosenblum/blint.git
cd blint
\`\`\`

(Optional) Itâ€™s recommended to create a virtual environment and install any dependencies:

\`\`\`cmd
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you have dependencies
\`\`\`

## Usage

> **Note:** \`blint\` is designed to run on Windows systems since batch files (\`.bat\`) are Windows-specific scripts.

Run \`blint\` by executing the Python script and passing the batch file path as an argument from Command Prompt:

\`\`\`cmd
python blint.py path\to\script.bat
\`\`\`
